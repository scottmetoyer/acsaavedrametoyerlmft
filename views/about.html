								<p>In the world of web design, we tend to become preoccupied with the here and now. In &#8220;Resilient Web Design&#8221;, Jeremy Keith emphasizes the importance of learning from the past in order to better prepare ourselves for the future. So, perhaps we should stop and think more beyond our present moment? The following is an excerpt from Jeremy&#8217;s web book.<span id="more-61"></span></p>
								<p>I&#8217;ve been really liking the idea of wrapped scarf tops recently, but sadly haven&#8217;t been able to find one long enough to wrap around enough times. I thought it was time to get a little crafty and make one myself. Crazy simple and you&#8217;ll wonder why you haven&#8217;t done this before!</p>
								<p>Materials and processes have changed and evolved over the past millennium or so. Gutenberg&#8217;s invention of movable type was a revolution in production. Whereas it would have taken just as long to create a second copy of the Book of Kells as it took to create the first, multiple copies of the Gutenberg bible could be produced with much less labour. Even so, many of the design patterns such as drop caps and columns were carried over from illuminated manuscripts. The fundamental design process remained the same: knowing the width and height of the page, designers created a pleasing arrangement of elements.</p>
								<p>The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Eliptical talk. We the best. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Wraith talk. Surround yourself with angels. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Surround yourself with angels. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.</p>
